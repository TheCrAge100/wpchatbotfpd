# Configurating the Assistant Settings

Configure settings for your Assistants by adding your below.

If you have developed a Assistant, you will need the id of the assistant - is usually starts with "asst_".

Enter your Assistant ID instead of ChatGPT. Set the 'Use Assistant ID' to 'Yes'.

Otherwise, you can leave the Assistant ID field blank and set the usage to 'No'.

More information can be found here https://platform.openai.com/playground?mode=assistant.

## Using Multiple Assistants

You can integrate Assistants into your platform using one of shortcode configurations below.

Each configuration requires either 'primary', 'alternate' or a Assistant ID, denoted as 'asst_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'.

Assistants work with both 'floating' and 'embedded' styles.

**NOTE:** The 'primary' and 'alternate' assistants are set in the ChatGPT settings page.

**NOTE:** For best results ensure that the shortcode appears only once on the page.

## Example Usage

Use the following format to invoke the primary or alternate assistant:

*-* `[chatbot style="embedded" assistant="alternate"]` - Embedded style, Assistant as set in Alternate setting

*-* `[chatbot style="embedded" assistant="asst_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"]` - Embedded style, Assistant as set in Assistant ID setting
Mix and match the style and assistant attributes to suit your needs.

## Tips

*-* **Assistant Instructions**: Provide clear and concise instructions to tailor the assistantâ€™s responses to your specific needs.

*-* **Token Limits**: Adjust token limits based on the balance between detailed responses and performance considerations.

*-* **Retention Period**: A longer retention period can improve user experience by maintaining context but consider privacy implications.
