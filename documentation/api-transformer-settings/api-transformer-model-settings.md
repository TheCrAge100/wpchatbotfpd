# Configuring Transformer Model Settings

The Sentential Context Model empowers your chatbot to generate intelligent, content-driven responses directly from your website, eliminating the need for external AI platforms.  It's a new plugin feature designed to make your chatbot more intelligent and self-reliant. Instead of relying on external AI platforms, this model builds its knowledge base directly from your website's content. By analyzing and contextualizing information from your posts, pages, and other site elements, it generates meaningful, contextually aware responses tailored to your website visitors.

This feature is ideal for use cases where:

- You prefer not to connect to an external AI platform.
- Your content is highly specific or localized, making external data sources less relevant.
- Privacy and data control are top priorities for your site.
- With easy configuration and advanced options for fine-tuning, the Sentential Context Model ensures a seamless, content-driven chatbot experience.

**IMPORTANT**:

- Beta features should only be enabled in testing or staging environments.

- Avoid enabling beta features on live or production sites.

- Use at your own risk. Kognetiks assumes no liability for issues caused by beta features.
