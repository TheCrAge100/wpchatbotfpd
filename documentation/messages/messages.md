1. **System and Plugin Information**:
   - **Description**: Displays key information about your system and plugin, including PHP version, WordPress version, Chatbot version, and WordPress language code.
   - **Usage**: Use this information for troubleshooting and ensuring compatibility with your environment.

2. **API Test Results**:
   - **Description**: Shows the status of the connection to the OpenAI API.
   - **Details**: Indicates whether the connection was successful.
   - **Usage**: Check this status to verify that the chatbot can communicate with the OpenAI API. A successful connection is necessary for the chatbot to function correctly.

3. **Chatbot Diagnostics**:
   - **Description**: Allows you to select the level of diagnostics to be logged.
   - **Options**: 
     - `Off`: No logging.
     - `Success`: Success messages.
     - `Notice`: General messages.
     - `Failure`: Failure messages.
     - `Warning`: Warning massages.
     - `Error`: Error messages.
   - **Selection**: Choose the appropriate level based on your need for diagnostics information. `Off` is the default and recommended setting for general use. Use `Error` for in-depth troubleshooting. `Error` logs all levels.

   **NOTE:** You can enable error and console logging at anytime, however in the production releases of the chatbot all error logging has been commented.

4. **Custom Error Message**:
   - **Description**: This setting allows administrators to define a custom error message that will be displayed to users when the chatbot encounters an issue. This ensures a more consistent and branded user experience, even in cases of unexpected errors.
   - **Options**: Any text string that you want to use as the error message.
   - **Selection**: Enter your preferred error message in the provided text field on the "Messages" tab. An example of a custom error message could be:
     ```
     Sorry, it appears our chat isn't working right now. If you're looking for support, click <a href="https://www.kognetiks.com/">here</a>.
     ```
   - **Additional Requirements**:
     - **Chatbot Diagnostics**: Ensure that the Chatbot Diagnostics setting is turned from `Off` to `Error` to enable the display of custom error messages.
     - **WordPress Error Logging**: You may also need to turn on WordPress error logging to fully utilize this feature.

5. **Suppress Notices and Warnings**:
   - **Description**: Allows you to suppress notices and warnings such as those associated with the **Knowledge Navigator** and other administrative functions.  These messages and warnings are not shown to users, only to administrator.
   - **Options**: `On` or `Off`.
   - **Selection**: Choose `On` to suppress notices and warnings if you prefer a less verbose experience, otherwise set to `Off` to see all administrative messages associated with the chatbot.

6. **Suppress Attribution**:
   - **Description**: Allows you to suppress the attribution message ("Chatbot WordPress plugin by Kognetiks") displayed only in the `floating` style of the chatbot.
   - **Options**: `On` or `Off`.
   - **Selection**: Choose `On` to suppress the attribution message. Set to `Off` to display the message.

7. **Delete Plugin Data on Uninstall**:
   - **Description**: Determines whether to delete all plugin data when the plugin is uninstalled.
   - **Options**: `Yes` or `No`.
   - **Selection**: Choose `Yes` to delete all data when uninstalling the plugin, ensuring no residual data remains. Select `No` to retain data even after uninstallation, which can be useful if you plan to reinstall the plugin later.

## Steps to Configure

2. Review the **System and Plugin Information** to ensure compatibility and identify the current versions in use.

3. Check the **API Test Results** to confirm a successful connection to the OpenAI API.

4. Set the **Chatbot Diagnostics** level based on your need for error and performance logging.

5. Toggle **Suppress Notices and Warnings** to `On` or `Off` as desired.

6. Toggle **Suppress Attribution** to `On` or `Off` based on whether you want to hide the attribution message.

7. Decide whether to enable **Delete Plugin Data on Uninstall** by setting it to `Yes` or `No`.

## Tips
