# 📊 Analytics Package Overview (Premium Feature)

The **Analytics** tab in the Kognetiks Chatbot for WordPress plugin provides a powerful dashboard to help you track, measure, and optimize chatbot performance on your site.

The analytics package summarizes data for sentiment analysis, engagement analysis, message and session statistics, and token usage.  You can quickly evaluate period-over-period changes in total conversations, unique visitors, average sentiment scores, and positive conversations.  To give you further insights, you can filter for visitors only, chatbot responses only, or both together.

**Note**: Conversation logging must be enabled for message scoring.  Go to the Reporting tab, then scoll down to the Reporting Settings section to enable logging.
